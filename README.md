Welcome to City Search!

Here, you can search your favorite cities around the world! Cities are sorted by 
by their population in descending order. This project makes use of auto-filling 
the search bar. Try it out!

This application is a little boring. There's only auto-complete in it. Meaning, 
once you click "Search", nothing will happen (except for the fact that you search
term will be saved). This is just to show off the auto-complete program. 

Requirement:
- mysql database
- server to run/host project on
- IDE to change database parameters

TO-DO:
- Use AJAX for the login and register page instead of header redirections.
