# City Search app

Welcome to City Search!

Create an account before using the browser app.
Here, you can search your favorite cities around the world! Cities are sorted by 
by their population in descending order. This project makes use of auto-filling 
the search bar. Try it out!

Your search history will be stored and displayed as well, but only if it's a 
valid city!

This application is a little boring. There's only auto-complete in it. Meaning, 
once you click "Search", nothing will happen (except for the fact that you search
term will be saved). This is just to show off the auto-complete program. 

Setup:
- Change the constants in the "databaseConstants.php" file to your mysql database
    parameters.
- Run the "createTables.php" file.
- ???
- Profit!!

TO-DO:
- Use AJAX for the login and register page instead of header redirections.
